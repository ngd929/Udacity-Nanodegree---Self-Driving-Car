# Ud-ISDCND-SelfDrivingCarSimulation
Udacity Intro to Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Project : Joy Ride (Simple Self-Driving Car Simulation)

## Joy Ride - Project Overview
This is a quick project that gives you a chance to write code that controls a simulated car. This project has three parts (but you will only submit part three).

1. **Part One** - Drag Race: In this part you'll write code that lets a car jump over a grove of trees. This might not be a common scenario for a self driving car but it will get you familiar with the programming interface.
2. **Part Two** - Circular Track: You'll write code that lets a car navigate a circular track. In doing so you'll explore the relationship between steering angle and turning radius.
3. **Part Three** - Parallel Park: In this part you'll write a sequence of instructions that successfully parallel parks a car.
